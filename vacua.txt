moduli of vacua:

* constant solutions --- same for any spacetime! hence useful beyond R^n

* distinction between different versions of "space": the solutions (e.g., as derived stack) vs what functions/observables can see (i.e., the affinization)
===> this is especially important at quantum level, as we deform the algebra of functions/observables

* at classical level, there are then three relevant spaces: the derived stack \cM, the affinization \rM, and the (semi)stable open locus \cM^s inside \cM

* for many SUSY gauge theories (especially with non-adjoint fields), the affinization does not see "anti-fields" of the BV formulation as they disappear by Higgs mechanism on the stable locus \cM^s

* kempf-ness theorem is applicable in many situations to affinization of classical vacua: it relates SUSY situation (symplectic reduction where moment map is "D-flat condition") to a problem in algebraic geometry (GIT quotient) [cite Luty-Taylor]

* the accidental/surprising isomorphism of some GIT quotients (but not stacks!) relates affinized moduli of classical vacua of distinct SUSY gauge theories: Seiberg duality is a good example


On the GIT equivalence:

For each theory, we have three important spaces
\begin{itemize}
\item the derived stack of constant solutions $\cM = V/G$ where $V$ denotes the constant sections of the fields and $G$ denotes the gauge group;
\item its affinization $M = V \sslash G = |\cM|$;
\item the substack of ``generic'' points $\cM^\circ$.
\end{itemize}
These are related by maps
\[
\cM^\circ \hookrightarrow \cM \to M
\]
and we require (to fit with the GIT story) that
\[
\Spec(\RR\Gamma(\cM^\circ, \cO)) = |\cM^\circ| = M.
\]
In other words, the important algebraic data is seen generically, ignoring the stacky points.

In the setting of Seiberg duality, we have a diagram
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
\cM^\circ_e \arrow[d] & \cM^\circ_m \\
M_e \arrow[r, "\cong"] & M_m
\end{tikzcd}
\]
where the subscripts indicate the electric/magnetic theory.
It is a theorem of Weyl that the affinizations agree.

It would be convenient if we had a map on the substacks of generic points.
Can we build one?

**** after some thinking ****

I don't think there's an obvious map. 

If you think about the quarks $\cQ = \Hom(\CC^N, \CC^F)$, then the quotient $\cQ/\GL_N$ is the affine cone of the grassmannian $\Gr_N(\CC^F)$. 
This quotient admits a natural dual/perpendicular map to $\Gr_{F-N}(\CC^F)$, 
but there is no canonical way (I can see) to lift it to the level of the Stiefel manifold 
(i.e., bases for these subspaces, which provide matrices that parametrize the actual vacua).
On the other hand, if we pick a nice open in a grassmannian,
then I think there is a natural section of the Stiefel manifold (i.e., basis for each subspace) and we can find a corresponding section of the dual Stiefel manifold.

Note that on the electric side there is a natural map
\[
Q \times Q^\dagger/\SL_N \supset \cM^\circ_e \to \End(\CC^F) \times \Gr_N(\CC^F)
\]
sending the pair $(q, q^\dagger)$ to $(q^\dagger q, \im(q))$.
Here $q$ is generic and hence has maximal rank, so the image is $N$-dimensional,
and likewise $q^\dagger$ is maximal rank, so that the composite $q^\dagger q$ is a rank $N$ endomorphism.

Claim: This map is an injection.

Idea: Given a full rank $q$ and the composite $q^\dagger q$, we can solve for $q^\dagger$ uniquely. 
The choice of $q$ as a representative of the dimension $N$ subspace in $\CC^F$ is free up to the $\SL_N$ action.

On magnetic side
